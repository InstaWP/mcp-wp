# WordPress MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for WordPress, allowing you to interact with your WordPress site using natural language via MCP-compatible clients like Claude for Desktop and Visual Studio Code. This server exposes various WordPress data and functionality as MCP tools.

## Usage

### Visual Studio Code

1. Make sure you have VS Code version 1.99 or later installed.
2. Ensure you have GitHub Copilot Chat extension installed and configured.
3. In your workspace, create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file (or use the one provided in this repository).
4. When you first use the MCP server, VS Code will prompt you for your WordPress credentials.
5. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P) and run **MCP: List Servers** to verify the server is configured.
6. Open the Chat view (Ctrl+Alt+I / Cmd+Option+I) and select **Agent** mode from the dropdown.
7. You can now interact with your WordPress site through the chat interface.

### Claude Desktop

1. Download and install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).
2. Open Claude Desktop settings and navigate to the "Developer" tab.
3. Copy the contents of the `claude_desktop_config.json.example` file.
4. Click "Edit Config" to open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file.
5. Copy paste the contents of the example file into the config file. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual values for the WordPress site. To generate the application keys, follow this guide - [Application Passwords](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/11/05/application-passwords-integration-guide#Getting-Credentials).
6. Save the configuration.
7. Restart Claude Desktop.

## Using with npx and .env file

You can run this MCP server directly using npx without installing it globally:

```bash
npx -y @instawp/mcp-wp
```

Make sure you have a `.env` file in your current directory with the following variables:

```env
WORDPRESS_API_URL=https://your-wordpress-site.com
WORDPRESS_USERNAME=wp_username
WORDPRESS_PASSWORD=wp_app_password
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 18 or higher) and npm installed.
*   **WordPress Site:** You need an active WordPress site with the REST API enabled.
*   **WordPress API Authentication:** Set up authentication for the WordPress REST API. This typically requires an authentication plugin or method (like Application Passwords).
*   **MCP Client:** You need an application that can communicate with the MCP Server. Supported clients include:
    * **Visual Studio Code** (version 1.99+) with GitHub Copilot Chat extension
    * **Claude Desktop**

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash

    cd wordpress-mcp-server
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add your WordPress API credentials:

    ```env
    WORDPRESS_API_URL=https://your-wordpress-site.com
    WORDPRESS_USERNAME=wp_username
    WORDPRESS_PASSWORD=wp_app_password
    ```

    Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

4.  **Build the Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5. **Configure VS Code:**

   * Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "inputs": [
         {
           "type": "promptString",
           "id": "wordpress-api-url",

           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   * VS Code will prompt you for your WordPress credentials when you first use the MCP server.

6. **Configure Claude Desktop (Optional):**

   * Open Claude Desktop settings and navigate to the "Developer" tab.
   * Click "Edit Config" to open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file.
   * Add a new server configuration under the `mcpServers` section. You will need to provide the **absolute** path to the `build/server.js` file and your WordPress environment variables.
   * Save the configuration.

### Running the Server

#### With VS Code

1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P) and run **MCP: List Servers**.
2. Select the "WordPress MCP" server and click "Start".
3. Open the Chat view (Ctrl+Alt+I / Cmd+Option+I) and select **Agent** mode from the dropdown.
4. You can now interact with your WordPress site through the chat interface.

#### With Claude Desktop

Once you've configured Claude Desktop, the server should start automatically whenever Claude Desktop starts.

#### From Command Line

You can also run the server directly from the command line for testing:

```bash
npm start
```

or in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Security

*   **Never commit your API keys or secrets to version control.**
*   **Use HTTPS for communication between the client and server.**
*   **Validate all inputs received from the client to prevent injection attacks.**
*   **Implement proper error handling and rate limiting.**
